ABOUT ME:

Greetings Professor Rabbi Moshe Plotkin,
​
​My name is Richard Hampton, and I’m currently in my senior year.  Web programming is a topic that has interested me for many years and I’m excited to finally be taking a class all about it.  So far at New Paltz, I’ve taken Computer Science 1 thru 3, Object Oriented Programming, Digital Logic, and Introduction to Engineering.  This semester I am taking Assembly and Software Programming, which are obviously pretty involved with computers as well.  From the classes here, I’ve gotten pretty decent with using Java, which is the first OOP language I’ve learned.  I’m familiar with HTML and CSS, as I used to make simple websites back in the day to host my Flash animations.  I also used to use PHP with SQL servers to set up “secure” (at least for the time) admin controls and whatnot for my small websites.  I also used to make games with Flash and it’s Actionscript language, which was pretty similar to Javascript.  Lately I’ve been trying to learn Swift to program iOs apps, as well as get better with Java.
​With this class I hope to refresh my skills with HTML, CSS, and PHP, as well as learn the new things HTML5 offers.  Apart from the project for this class this semester, I hope to put these skills to use in making a new website as a portfolio for my graphic design work.  I also have aspirations to make a web app to manipulate photographs, but that’s more of a distant goal.  Overall I’m excited for this class this semester and intend to work hard.  I’ll attach a picture of myself below.
 
Best,
Richard Hampton
